For example, the government could spend some money on pollution treatment and public health care, which gives people a healthy environment to live. In the other hand, the government should putting some Public Service Ads on the television that educating people to buy less and to live with low carbon lifestyle, which is also give people an idea that happiness does not means “more”, but “less” could help you to having a happy life. </p>

Once the businessman start produce product that is useful, people can enjoy the product longer that the products won’t became the trash quickly Once the U.S. government start to really doing things for people than the national happiness will raise. Eventually, the over-consuming issue will not exist anymore. </p>
