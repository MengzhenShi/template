			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>Too much material that has been wasted is not only the Issue that caused by the over-consuming; over-consuming is also caused environment pollution, suffering the people in the developing country and most importantly, it actually declaiming the nation happiness.</p>
			<p>Stuffs that had been made from factory are actually cause lots of serious environment problems. Since people in the well-developed country are shopping very often, companies just over extracting the resources from the nature. For example, they are chopping down the trees that cause so many nature species lost their homeland; they also extracting the oil too often that cause the oil spill; and the chemical emission happened when released those wastes. The pollution is destroying the natural and also destroying the health of us. In order to having enough supplies to support the demand of the over-consuming country, Lots of people in the developing country are force to work in the factory where is full of dirt and toxic gases and a huge percentage of kid in developing country drop their school to work. Consequently, those kids who are working in the factory are lost their future. Although over-consuming problem caused so many issues, but does over-consume really makes people in the U.S. feel happy? No, the national happiness is actually gone down in past fifty years because people are working even harder in order to consume. People don’t have time to enjoy things that make them happy; they working hard in their companies and go back home watch TV and the TV tell them to shop, than they spend all the money to buy things, eventually they have to work harder again. All of this problem could be worse and worse, but we can easily just stop by few ways.</p>
			<p> Those problems that caused by the over-consuming are seemed very severe, however, I believe that all the problems can be solved just in three ways, resetting the goal of our life, recycling in our life and taking back the government. </p>
			<p>In the nowadays, the goal of people in the developed country is “more” because people never feels enough. So, the only way to fix this problem is reset the goal from “more” to “less”, which is means that people need to start buying less. Instead of shopping all the time, people should spend more time on things that really make them happy, such staying with their family, reading some books, or going to cinema. I did not mean that people cannot consume anymore, but trying to buy locally and just buying things that people really need. For example, try to be too enthusiastic by just watch the ads on the television because sometime the real goods is not as good as ads said on the TV; and To become a rational consumer, people should always considering whether the items is useful or not before the purchase. “More” is always makes people feel tired, because more stuff that store in people’s house more housework they are going to do. Thus, setting the goal of “less” is not only relaxing the people but also solved the over-consuming problems.</p>
			<p>Some may ask that what about those thing we already brought? So, the next step is to recycling. Recycling could be the most important part that in the protection of our environment. In the early years, people did not pay attention to the recycling, and they just throw all the trash that store in their house together, which cause the disposal station is not be able to separate them. So the disposal station just burn the trash and bury them, this is the reason why toxic pollution is seems critically. Recycling does not only means throw the trash separately, but also means that try to buy green product such as, recycled paper, hybrid cars or biodegradable products. So that the resources that we used can be reuse again after it had bed recycled. For example, all the paper that we throw away can be recycle to make new paper; all tin bottle of soft drink that made form aluminum can be recycle to make bicycles. Although all people are start to do recycling, but it still not enough because the most important element of all the problems are the government. </p>
