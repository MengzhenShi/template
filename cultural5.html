			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>Too much material that has been wasted is not only the Issue that caused by the over-consuming; over-consuming is also caused environment pollution, suffering the people in the developing country and most importantly, it actually declaiming the nation happiness.</p>
			<p>Stuffs that had been made from factory are actually cause lots of serious environment problems. Since people in the well-developed country are shopping very often, companies just over extracting the resources from the nature. For example, they are chopping down the trees that cause so many nature species lost their homeland; they also extracting the oil too often that cause the oil spill; and the chemical emission happened when released those wastes. The pollution is destroying the natural and also destroying the health of us. In order to having enough supplies to support the demand of the over-consuming country, Lots of people in the developing country are force to work in the factory where is full of dirt and toxic gases and a huge percentage of kid in developing country drop their school to work. Consequently, those kids who are working in the factory are lost their future. Although over-consuming problem caused so many issues, but does over-consume really makes people in the U.S. feel happy? No, the national happiness is actually gone down in past fifty years because people are working even harder in order to consume. People donâ€™t have time to enjoy things that make them happy; they working hard in their companies and go back home watch TV and the TV tell them to shop, than they spend all the money to buy things, eventually they have to work harder again. All of this problem could be worse and worse, but we can easily just stop by few ways.</p>
