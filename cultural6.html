			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p> The government is always pay the vital role of managing the country, Thus the last step of solve the nation problem is taking back the government, which is means that the government should start to do something that really for the people. Although developing the economics is important, but protecting our homeland is also important. The government should put more attention on raising the national happiness rate; instead of encourage people to shop. For example, the government could spend some money on pollution treatment and public health care, which gives people a healthy environment to live. In the other hand, the government should putting some Public Service Ads on the television that educating people to buy less and to live with low carbon lifestyle, which is also give people an idea that happiness does not means “more”, but “less” could help you to having a happy life. </p>
			<p>Once people are having life with a goal of “less”, to the trash that flow through the country will decrease and the demand of the good will decrease which gives kids in the poor country a chance to go to school. Once the businessman start produce product that is useful, people can enjoy the product longer that the products won’t became the trash quickly Once the U.S. government start to really doing things for people than the national happiness will raise. Eventually, the over-consuming issue will not exist anymore. </p>
