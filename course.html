		<h2>Course Retrospective</h2>
		<p> Compare to all the simple writing I had written in my high school years, university writing requires student to have higher writing skills. There are many different types of writing courses that offered in Michigan State University. Unlike to the typical writing courses, WRA 110 –Writing: Science and Technology is one of the universities writing courses contains five projects that all related to the technology. WRA110 not only require students have high level writing skills but also requires students be able to dealing with some computing skills such as, creating web version of student’s profiles or creating a video on your own. Through the semester we were ask to have deep understanding different views to the writhing, such as how to expressing our thoughts Methodologically, sociologically and ontologically. You might have no idea what the meaning of these three terms, but you will discover yourself when you taking this course; and understanding these terms can help you to improve your writing skills. After I did all these works, I felt I had a huge improvement in how to making decisions on choosing topic, analyzing materials, organizing thoughts correctly and arranging texts systematically.  </p>
		<p> The first project, lived experiences project, required us to write a narrative that dealing with a piece of technology, which impacts our major. Unlike to the formal academic essay, this project is relaxed because it did not require too much on the format, however it can also be a challenge for the freshmen student who did not have a clear view of what their discipline actually is. For my paper I told the story of how a shopping app on the smart phone changed my major by arguing that smartphone shopping apps become more and more popular because buying items on shopping apps is much more convenience than the past. Since the Shopping app is related to the supply chain, I eventually chose the major of supply chain management. In my paper, I described the functions of the shopping app and what business field has been impacted the most by this technology; In order to be able to do well on this project, you might need to do a little bit research on the piece of technology that you have chosen and then recall an experience in your life that related to that technology. I think this project is very helpful because it teaches how to write a narrative that not only just telling my own story, but also proving a specific purpose at same time. Most importantly, to write a good narrative, you are also need the design some dialogues in your writing, because it can expressing you emotion more directly instead of just telling the audience how did felt at that point. I did not have many experiences to write a narrative so it is kind a challenge to me but once you are writing you own story, you will found out writing a narrative is interesting. </p>
		<p> The second project is called Cultural Analysis paper, in this paper you are require to introduce the pop cultural and you need to find an artifact of pop culture like a video game, a music video a movie or a TV show. You will need to explain how these artifacts that related to the social issue or the pop cultural that you choose. Personally, I think this project is interesting because it still gives you a lots of freedom to be creative, however, choose a topic is the most important thing before you start writing because after you describe the social issue and its impact, you need to come up with the solutions to warp up you essay. Overall, the cultural analysis project has a little more challenge than the first one because in this project, you will need to start reading some materials and doing some researching in order to provide evidences for you project. To begin this project Dr. Daniel let us watch a video call south park during the class, this video is about how video games impact the society. You will do the class activity and write a discussion forum, you don’t need to complain about it because this activity is helping you to understand what is the purpose of the project and also give you a guide to choose your topic. The goal of cultural analysis project is to improve the analysis skill of students, so that in the future life, student could have better ability to analyzing any types of media and understand the proposal of any artifacts.</p>
		<p>The third project is called formal research paper, and this could be painful to the student who did not learn anything about their major. I believe this could be the hardest in the whole semester. You are expected to write an informative paper that contains a large amount of research on your discipline and create you own understanding of how writing, researching and communicating on your discipline. This paper is also the longest paper you are ask to write in this semester, thus it is necessary to do the different type of researching in order to do well on this project. There are lots of resources given to you that can help you to collect the information that you need. During the class, your will need to do a worksheet that asking you to searching some articles on the website that is created by the MSU library. This websites contains a large amount of reading materials and your can easily find the articles related to your discipline by just type in the key words. The most interesting researching you are required to do is to interviewing someone who is already practice in this discipline or someone who are teaching in this discipline. Although this paper is one of the most difficult assignments you given, but it give you a great opportunity to learn about you discipline and this is also helpful because before you step into studies of you discipline, you must have a deep understanding of you major, otherwise you might be lost while you start your major. The format that required writing a formal research paper is a brand new format for me. I never write the research paper before. In order to write correctly I also did the research on how to write a research paper. The project allows students to learn a lots of information about how their field is operating and how to planning the career path. So you should get prepared before writing the research paper. </p>
		<p>Finally, the Remix project, in this project you will be group up with in four people to make a documentary. The topic that you choose has to from the previous project you have done so far. This is the most interesting project I ever had in this class because you don’t need to write any academic essay in this class the only thing about writhing is the write a memo that recoding the process of makes the documentary. The most challenging part of the project for me is the video making; I am the person who takes the responsibility to make the whole video, at the beginning, I don’t even know how the video is made form, and I am confusing with so many things such as, cutting the video into different part, how to connecting the films we shot or how to add the background music. However, the process of filming the documentary has so much fun, each of member in you group are required to acting. You need to design the dialogues and scenes; it is just like you are filming a movie. We did not have too much time to work on our project together because everyone in the group has different schedule so having a good plan is important. I think the plan we had is helpful. During the week, we had several times meeting and we will give each member different tasks to complete until next meeting. For example, in the first meeting I had been told to figure out which app that can help us to make the video and how to use it. In the seconded meeting I was decided to find some resources about the topic. During the weekend, we all met together and went to the mall to film. The memo is an important part of the Remix project because it allows you to tell the professor know how well you did in you group, and what contributes you did for the project. </p>
		<p>Outside of the class, you are require to learn another skill that is not be found in other college writing class, which is the to make a web site by writing the HTML codes. Personally, I think this is harder than any of project we did through the semester because I am not an engineer major student. Making a websites require us to learn a lots of coding knowledge and coding a website is really drive me crazy. Overall, I think all the projects we did through all the semester really improved me a lot. I believe that WRA 110 is a great class that not only teach student high level writhing skill, but also a class that training student to have ability to working as a group and giving student a better sense of understanding technology. If you are not someone who very enjoys the typical writing class, WRA 110 could be the best choice for you. </p>
