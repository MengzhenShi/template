			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Look at things that you have in your house. How many of them are still functioning but you have not used for a while? Those items could be a music player, a smart phone or even a pair of high-heel shoes. Have you ever wondered why you are buying things to store in your house only to throw them out eventually? The reason that you stop using most of those things is not because they are not be able to function, but because they are buying things that they actually don’t need. People in the United State are always buying brand new items, and the country became a nation of consumers. Consequently, shopping has become the most important entertainment in people’s life, which caused lots of issues both environmentally and socially.</p>
