			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>“In both the 60 and 70 AD, to enhance the competitiveness of their organizations were trying to standardize and improve their internal processes to produce products with better quality and lower cost. The prevailing thought at the time was strong engineering and design and manufacturing operations are coordinated, the prerequisite for market access demands, and thus gain more market share.” (Intro to SCM, 2013) The Supply Chain Management was founded when people started to seek ways in order to reduce the business cost back to 60AD. Until today, people are still seeking and searching in the field of Supply Chain Management. Look through the development of the global technology and economics, globalization is happening dramatically. In the field of manufacturing, the product may designed in Japan, and the raw material my purchased in China or Brazil, and accessories and repairs may produced in Taiwan or India than all the items will assembled in China. Eventually, the product will sale to the world. However, before the product is flow in the market, there may have number of companies that participated in the production. Since the different of location, produce ability and the administration ability existing between different companies, so that the complex supply chain web had been created. Although there are number of views of Supply Chain Management, but let’s step back to look at the traditional view of Supply Chain Management. </p>
			<p>The traditional view of Supply Chain Management is that all organizations either manufacture products, provide services that someone values. “The supply chain encompasses all organization and activities associated with the flow and transformation of goods from the raw materials stage, through to the end user, as well as the associated information flow both up and down the supply chain”(R.Handfield and nichols, 2002) In the other word, the traditional way to think about operations is a transformation process that transfers inputs to some ways to create valuable goods and services. </p>
