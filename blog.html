			<p/>The purpose of the video is try to tell everyone that love is beautiful and everyone should to face their 
			 love bravely. Just trying to believe that everything is getting better.no matter how others look at you or the 
			 your love has not been accepted. Author uses this video atempts achieve its purpose by tell us the story between
			  he and his uncle, and the author also read a poem to us, which is impressive. When Oral Robert'gay grandson are 
			  telling us the story he also add his felt into the story. In the orther words, Oral Rober's grandson was telling
			  us his feeling in each polt of story. I remmenber he said he was upset with his uncle somehow and at the end of the 
			  story he said it gets better, so it was helping us to understand how the emotion of the Oral Rober's grandson was changing.
			      I believe that the structrue of the video contains four parts, at the begining the video shows us some piece of 
			 poems in the slience mode and the following part is the inroduction of the performer himslef. The third part is 
			 the story telling part, which the performer telling us the the poem and the story that he wants to tell the audience.
			 The last part of the video is performer's conclusion about his overall feeling, and the performer bring up the idea of 
			 "it get better".
			     This video's structure helps me to understand how I revise my Lived Experiences project in three ways. Firstly, the 
			 video helps me understand how to write a narrative, which is not only telling the story but also need write about what 
			 you think and how you feel, sometimes even what its tastes. secondly, I lived exoeriences project should have a specail 
			 begining like put a poem at the begining. At the last think my essay could developing with the time is changing.</p>
