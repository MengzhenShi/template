			<h2>WEEK activity 1:</h>
			       <p>The purpose of the video is try to tell everyone that love is beautiful and everyone should to face their 
			 love bravely. Just trying to believe that everything is getting better.no matter how others look at you or the 
			 your love has not been accepted. Author uses this video atempts achieve its purpose by tell us the story between
			  he and his uncle, and the author also read a poem to us, which is impressive. When Oral Robert'gay grandson are 
			  telling us the story he also add his felt into the story. In the orther words, Oral Rober's grandson was telling
			  us his feeling in each polt of story. I remmenber he said he was upset with his uncle somehow and at the end of the 
			  story he said it gets better, so it was helping us to understand how the emotion of the Oral Rober's grandson was changing.
			      I believe that the structrue of the video contains four parts, at the begining the video shows us some piece of 
			 poems in the slience mode and the following part is the inroduction of the performer himslef. The third part is 
			 the story telling part, which the performer telling us the the poem and the story that he wants to tell the audience.
			 The last part of the video is performer's conclusion about his overall feeling, and the performer bring up the idea of 
			 "it get better".
			     This video's structure helps me to understand how I revise my Lived Experiences project in three ways. Firstly, the 
			 video helps me understand how to write a narrative, which is not only telling the story but also need write about what 
			 you think and how you feel, sometimes even what its tastes. secondly, I lived exoeriences project should have a specail 
			 begining like put a poem at the begining. At the last think my essay could developing with the time is changing.
			 <h3>WEEK activity 2：</h3><p>In order to identify the froup of people targeted in the video, I divided those people into three groups.</p>
                Parents, kids and the Blizzards game makers. All of parents in the video are all love their kids so much, so
                they support their kids to do everything. I believe that the group of kid in the video are all addicted to play
                the online games,word of warcraft, and they are the best friends. At last the Blizzards game makers, they trying
                their best to attract people to play the game. Only thing in their mind is the number of plaers.
                     The vedio shows us several sociel problems. First of all, more and more kids including adults are addicted to
                to the virtual world which is video. Those group forgot to work and also forgot how to live like a normal human 
                becuase of being too addicted the game. For example, when other kids are socielizing with others by doing exercise 
                on the playground, those kids who addicted to the games a sitting in one place all day long to play the game. The 
                next sociel issue is occuring on the parent. Parents are always love their kids, but they did wrong thing by allow 
                their kids to do everything they wants to do, inculding thing that is absolutly wrong. This is a issue of spoil! 
                The last issue that the video mentioned about is occuring on the game makers, those game makers does not care about
                how the game effects people's life badly, however they only care about how many palyers are playing their game; 
                which cause many problems.
                    The video'creator was kind of exaggerate the social issue, but the propose of the creator is appeal those
                kids who are addicated to the virtual world can stopp playing the online games and get back to the normal life
                and to be sociel with other. In additional, the video creator are also wants to tell all the parents that saying
                no to theis kids could also be a kind of love. In other word, the cideo creator are asking all the parents
                do their best to pull their back to the right track if their kids are addicted on some games.
                     I think it is a very good idea that the Video creator use the cartoon to show the sociel issue to 
              the us, which the kids(most of addicted people) will see, and also attractive.
              </p>
              <h4>Week activity 3</h4>
              <p>      The video we watched is a commercial for the Chrysler Car Company and it is taken place in the Detroit. As we all know that Detroit is the well know car city, unlike to the wind city or Now york city, Detroit is the best place the present the cars. To evaluate this advertisement, let’s start with the Imagery of Detroit. The first impression of this advertisement is factories that built around the city which give us a view that Detroit is a city that is doing great on developing the heavy industry. The following is showing some signature landmarks are representing the spirit of hard working, such as the steel arm. I think this is giving information to the audience that the quality of the cars produced form Detroit is the best in the world. </p>
              <p>      The background music Lose yourself is a song that largely written during the filming of 8 mile and plays to the themes if the film. The writer is the rapper singer Eminem. He wrote this song because Eminem has overcome some personal problem that held back him and he uses this song to win the respect of people’s respect. Same with the theme of the Chrysler’s commercial; which was the cars use it quality to gain the respects of people. </p>
              <p>      The tagline “Imported from Detroit” is a symbol that going trough the whole commercial, which point out that the thing that imported from the Detroit is the best because the whole city has the spirit of hard working and the made the highest quality cars. </p>
              <h5>Blog 1</h5>
              <p>In the first class of the semester, I learned the basic idea of the Tier 1 writing in university. WRA 110 is a class that developing student’s writing skills, knowledge by allowing students to attending different kinds of activities. WRA 110 is also requiring student to have great writing skills but also the skill that can deal with the computer. In the first day of class, Dr. Daniel, our instructor, introduce the website called Github, I did not realize what is it in the first place, the only thing I know is we need to put our projects in the profile so people can view it online. WRA110 not only require students have high level writing skills but also requires students be able to dealing with some computing skills such as, creating web version of student’s profiles or creating a video on your own.</p>
              <p>The first assignment is called lived experience project, which require student to create a narrative detailing how a piece of technology has impacted our choice of major. We are required to describe our major and also describe an experience that related to both the piece of technology and our major. This is totally new thing to me, because the essay that I have written before is formal academic essay, and I did not have much experience to write the narrative, I hope I can try my best to do well on this project.  </p>
              <h6>Blog 2</h6>
              <p>Through the week of writing the narrative, I learned how to writing to share my experiences. We start we setting the goals, which is the purpose of my narrative. I feel writing a narrative has much more freedoms than other formal of writing because I can write whatever and however I wish. Similar to the formal academic essay, narrative also has the strategies for argument. I learned three rhetorical appeals in order to use them to construct an effective written argument. There are logical appeals ethical appeals and emotional appeals. You may ask what is an appeal? Appeal is a sense that you use to persuade others to agree you opinion.</p>
              <p>I think this project is very helpful because it teaches how to write a narrative that not only just telling my own story, but also proving a specific purpose at same time. Most importantly, to write a good narrative, you are also need the design some dialogues in your writing, because it can expressing you emotion more directly instead of just telling the audience how did felt at that point Through this project I also gain more information about my major and my possible career path; and this is very important to me because I have to know something about my major before I started. After the first project, we started our second project, which was called the cultural analysis proposal. In this project we need to analysis of a cultural artifact, to investigate a specific social issue and how it formed.  </p>
              <h7>Blog 3</h7>
              <p>The second project is called Cultural Analysis paper, in this paper you are require to introduce the pop cultural and you need to find an artifact of pop culture like a video game, a music video a movie or a TV show. You will need to explain how these artifacts that related to the social issue or the pop cultural that you choose. I think this project is interesting because it let you to do the research on the pop culture; I did the over-consuming issue in the US. To begin this project Dr. Daniel let us watch a funny video during the class, this video is about how video games impact the society. I think this project is interesting because it still gives you a lots of freedom to be creative, however, choose a topic is the most important thing before you start writing because after you describe the social issue and its impact, you need to come up with the solutions to warp up you essay. </p>
              <p>We watched a video about a group of kid who addicted to the game and how the parents and game makers related to them and you will do the class activity, this activity are helping you to understand what to purpose of the project. In the addition, you will also need to come up with a solution to the issue that you choose. you don’t need to complain about it because this activity is helping you to understand what is the purpose of the project and also give you a guide to choose your topic.</p>
              <h8>Blog 4</h8>
              <p>The purpose of second project is learning the qualities of effective analytical writing. We need start to do the research to our own writing because a formal analysis usually requires research. A main point that the Dr. Daniel teaches us is that Research-based rather than personal-based writing. To analyzing a social effect we need to do a lots of research, so that we can have a well-developed thoughts to writing our paper and also make the paper highly persuasively. The goal of cultural analysis project is to improve the analysis skill of students, so that in the future life, student could have better ability to analyzing any types of media and understand the proposal of any artifacts.</p>
              <p>After you did all the research, you need to organize your information, so that you need to ask yourself that who is your audience and how to make you material to be interesting to you audience. Through this project, I realized that evidence is the most important part of your paper especially in the college level of writing because your personal-based writing is never enough persuade a large amount of audience. Although you have a very decent evident to support you paper, but you still need to analyze the evidence and the show the your audience why the subject you are analyzing is important to them. </p>
              <h9>Blog 5</h9>
              <p> As usual, we will finish the drafting activity of our project before we start the project, but different form the pervious activities we have done in the class, this time we start to research different kind of academic articles and write the bibliography of it. To writing a formal research paper could be painful to the student who did learn anything about their major. In the other hand, this project can also be helpful because before you step into studies of you discipline, you must have a deep understanding of you major, otherwise you might be lost in you discipline. The interesting things in this project are you need to interview someone who is already practice in this discipline or someone who are teaching in this discipline. The format of the formal research paper is a brand new format for me, I never write the research paper before. In order to write correct I did the research on it. So be prepared. I felt I had a huge improvement in how to making decisions on choosing topic, analyzing materials, organizing thoughts correctly and arranging texts systematically.  </p>
              <h10>Blog 6</h10>
              <p>The formats in the writing class is important because is give your audience a clear view to read your paper and guide your audience to follow your thoughts. In the WRA 110, you will need to use two different formats to write you essay. The American psychological Association (APA) style is one of these two formats; this format standard for papers in the social and behavioral sciences as well as in education and business. The other formats is the Modern Language Association (MLA), The MLA formats use to write a paper in the humanities.</p>
              <p> In order to organize the third project, Formal research paper, I did lots of research on my discipline, there has a trick to find the articles that you need efficiently which is to write down all the key words might appears in your research paper and research the words instead of questioning. For example, I will do the research on the supply chain management, so I will probably search the words like, logistic, purchase or delivery. During the class, your will need to do a worksheet that asking you to searching some articles on the website that is created by the MSU library. This websites contains a large amount of reading materials and your can easily find the articles related to your discipline by just type in the key words. The most interesting researching you are required to do is to interviewing someone who is already practice in this discipline or someone who are teaching in this discipline. And the class introduced us the website called pro-Quest which is a web that is very useful to find the articles. </p>
              <h11>Blog 7</h11>
              <p>Formal research paper is type of academic writing that mostly involved everything, and different subjects that your researching have different way to write about it. During the class, Dr. Daniel introduced the three views to organizing the thoughts, their Methodologically view, sociologically view and ontologically view. You might have no idea what the meaning of these three terms, but you will discover yourself when you taking this course; and understanding these terms can help you to improve you writing skills. </p>
              <p>Search the evidence on the Internet sometimes is not enough, you will need to interview or do the survey with someone who has deeper understanding with the thesis that you are researching for. For example, I am doing the research on supply chain management, so I find the professor that is teaching the supply chain management, and also find a manager who is currently work in a logistic company. I took the notes and organize those notes into to the paper. I felt fun when I doing the research. I never write the research paper before. In order to write correctly I also did the research on how to write an research paper. The project allows students to learn a lots of information about how their field is operating and how to planning the career path. So you should get prepared before writing the research paper.</p>
              <h12>Blog 8</h12>
              <p>WRA110 is not only required student to have high level writing skills but also requires students be able to dealing with some computing skills such as, creating web version of student’s profiles or using app to make video. These computing activities made the WRA 110 more enjoyable, other than just writing in whole semester. The fourth project we did is to make a video; we are group up with four students to make the video. The topic that you choose has to from the previous project you have done so far. This the most fun project compare to others. During the class, we watched a documentary video, and the main purpose of the documentary is trying to discover that people in the ancient time had very have very high level of medical treatment technique. Such as the brain surgery, and those knowledge in the medical field is came from the God. It gives us a basic idea of how the documentary that we are going to create looks like. According to the structure of the documentary.</p>
              <p>I think there are four major part of documentary, first of all, is the introduction, they introduced couple issues that people are not have well understanding right now, such as, why those skull have holes and how is there is god exist in the world who teach them the knowledge that help them cure the illness. Secondly, the video put the focus on people in the ancient world can do the brain surgery. Thirdly, the video talks about the book “Huang Di Nei Jing” that have written hundreds years ago. At last, the video mention the same issue that show in the beginning again, to connecting the next video.</p>
              <h13>Blog 9</h13>
              <p>Our group has the first meeting to make our video; first thing we need to do is decide the topic. Select a topic is the most important part in our video making process, but we did not spent too much that on it because the other topics that we had contains too much culture elements which is hard to present in our video. The shopping addiction issue is more related to the real life, and we can easily find different kind of resources and organizing in to our video. After we decided the topic, give each group member different task to do. The most challenging part of the project for me is the video making; I am the person who takes the responsibility to make the whole video, at the beginning, I don’t even know how the video is made form, and I am confusing with so many things such as, cutting the video into different part, how to connecting the films we shot or how to add the background music. So I start to look up how to make the video and how to organized the video in order to communicate with our audience. The memo is an important part of the Remix project because it allows you to tell the professor know how well you did in you group, and what contributes you did for the project.</p>
              <h14>Blog 10</h14>
              <p>We divided our documentary into four main parts, introduction, interviewing, acting and solution. Is this structure looks familiar? Yes, I think to make a documentary is just like to writing a paper with different strategies that guiding people the understanding the thesis.  I think researching on the news and articles are the most beneficial for our video because it gives us the real world information about our topic, and we collect that information in our narration. The narration in our video is one of important parts is our video, and I did research to design the narration. The part of interviewing different students is the most effective aspect of our video. We put the interview part in the beginning of our video because when audiences are watching the video they can ask themselves the same question that appears in the video to help them understand what the issues is. And the interview could also be a content of our video because the questions in the interview are basically what the video is about. I think I learned a lot form this project because I felt I am improving myself in organizing materials and also realizing the teamwork is important. You need to design the dialogues and scenes; it is just like you are filming a movie. We did not have too much time to work on our project together because everyone in the group has different schedule so having a good plan is important.</p>
              <h15>Blog 11</h15>
              <p>When Dr. Daniel introducing the course retrospective project, I realized that the semester is close to the end. In this project, we are requiring to write a summery of this semester and sit up a website about all the works we have done during this semester. And we are requiring making a web version of our summery of each project we have done through the semester. When we writing our final draft, we should include things we learned in this class, and also give the feedback to the student that will taking WRA110 class for next year. The goal of the final project is to give new student a view of how this course is about and what will they accomplishing in the course. The most important, our project should give student an basic idea how to do well in this semester. Look over this semester, I felt I had a huge improvement in how to making decisions on choosing topic, analyzing materials, organizing thoughts correctly and arranging texts systematically. I think all the projects we did through all the semester really improved me a lot. I believe that WRA 110 is a great class that not only teach student high level writhing skill, but also a class that training student to have ability to working as a group and giving student a better sense of understanding technology.   </p>
              <h16>Blog12</h16>
              <p>As I said before, WRA 100 is a class that not only about the writing, but also teach you how to deal with the computer. Outside of the class, you are require to learn another skill that is not be found in other college writing class, which is the to make a web site by writing the HTML codes. Maybe some one will say this is not a big deal but personally, I think this is harder than any of project we did through the semester because I am not an engineer major student. I never using my computer to make anything at all, expect the video I made before. Only things I will use my computer is the chatting with my friend or watching some videos. Making a websites require us to learn a lots of coding knowledge and coding a website is really drive me crazy.</p>
              <p>At beginning of this semester, Dr. Daniel introduce the website called Codecademy, this is a website that teaching people how to us html to code the web site. I did learn a lot form this website, and I found out it is interesting to learn the code. Although. I still feel unfamiliar with the code, but making a website is fun. Overall, I think all the projects we did through all the semester really improved me a lot.</p>
