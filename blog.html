			<p/>WEEK activity 1：
			The purpose of the video is try to tell everyone that love is beautiful and everyone should to face their 
			 love bravely. Just trying to believe that everything is getting better.no matter how others look at you or the 
			 your love has not been accepted. Author uses this video atempts achieve its purpose by tell us the story between
			  he and his uncle, and the author also read a poem to us, which is impressive. When Oral Robert'gay grandson are 
			  telling us the story he also add his felt into the story. In the orther words, Oral Rober's grandson was telling
			  us his feeling in each polt of story. I remmenber he said he was upset with his uncle somehow and at the end of the 
			  story he said it gets better, so it was helping us to understand how the emotion of the Oral Rober's grandson was changing.
			      I believe that the structrue of the video contains four parts, at the begining the video shows us some piece of 
			 poems in the slience mode and the following part is the inroduction of the performer himslef. The third part is 
			 the story telling part, which the performer telling us the the poem and the story that he wants to tell the audience.
			 The last part of the video is performer's conclusion about his overall feeling, and the performer bring up the idea of 
			 "it get better".
			     This video's structure helps me to understand how I revise my Lived Experiences project in three ways. Firstly, the 
			 video helps me understand how to write a narrative, which is not only telling the story but also need write about what 
			 you think and how you feel, sometimes even what its tastes. secondly, I lived exoeriences project should have a specail 
			 begining like put a poem at the begining. At the last think my essay could developing with the time is changing.
			 	WEEK activity 2：In order to identify the froup of people targeted in the video, I divided those people into three groups.
                Parents, kids and the Blizzards game makers. All of parents in the video are all love their kids so much, so
                they support their kids to do everything. I believe that the group of kid in the video are all addicted to play
                the online games,word of warcraft, and they are the best friends. At last the Blizzards game makers, they trying
                their best to attract people to play the game. Only thing in their mind is the number of plaers.
                     The vedio shows us several sociel problems. First of all, more and more kids including adults are addicted to
                to the virtual world which is video. Those group forgot to work and also forgot how to live like a normal human 
                becuase of being too addicted the game. For example, when other kids are socielizing with others by doing exercise 
                on the playground, those kids who addicted to the games a sitting in one place all day long to play the game. The 
                next sociel issue is occuring on the parent. Parents are always love their kids, but they did wrong thing by allow 
                their kids to do everything they wants to do, inculding thing that is absolutly wrong. This is a issue of spoil! 
                The last issue that the video mentioned about is occuring on the game makers, those game makers does not care about
                how the game effects people's life badly, however they only care about how many palyers are playing their game; 
                which cause many problems.
                    The video'creator was kind of exaggerate the social issue, but the propose of the creator is appeal those
                kids who are addicated to the virtual world can stopp playing the online games and get back to the normal life
                and to be sociel with other. In additional, the video creator are also wants to tell all the parents that saying
                no to theis kids could also be a kind of love. In other word, the cideo creator are asking all the parents
                do their best to pull their back to the right track if their kids are addicted on some games.
                     I think it is a very good idea that the Video creator use the cartoon to show the sociel issue to 
              the us, which the kids(most of addicted people) will see, and also attractive.</p>
