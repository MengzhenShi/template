		<p>MEMORANDUM TO:	 Doctor Daniels</p>
<p>FROM:	 Mengzhen Shi</p>
<p>DATE:	 4/16/2014</p>
<p>SUBJECT:	 WRA 110 Group Project</p>
		<h3>Memo</h3>
		<p>The issue that we choose for our project is shopping addiction in the US, we choose this issue because shopping addiction is a common issue of our current society. This topic related lots of resources to help us composing for the project. For example, due to shopping has become the most important entertainment in people’s life, we can interview different people around us and collect different idea about the shopping addiction. In the other words, it is helping us to have deeper understanding of the issues and we could add those ideas in to our acting and explaining in our video.  </p>    
		<p>The composing for our issue helped us to better understand the shopping addiction in three aspects, how serous the issue is in our society, how people think about this issue and different solutions that people think to solve this problem. Since we interviewing different people and do more research on the shopping addiction for the project, we now knows that over-consuming happening in the US is because when people shopping it will make people feel happening inside, and the pricing off is really attractive for everyone. Most of people actually have no idea how serous the issue is.  </p> 
		<p>There are so many problems that we encounter during the organizing our documentary. First of all, we were struggling whether to start the video with a commercial advertising or just directly point out the issue we have. Secondly deciding what and where we should acting in our film to help the audience to understand the shopping addiction problem. Thirdly, what kind of people who we interview with can present in our film. At last, is the technical problem, which is to add the background music in our video and what kind of music we should add. Our video is trying to let the audience to image that they are addicted to the shopping, and if they do what problems they could possibly cause and how do they do to solve issue.  </p> 
		<p>Select a topic is the most important part in our video making process, but we did not spent too much that on it because the other topics that we had contains too much culture elements which is hard to present in our video. The shopping addiction issue is more related to the real life, and we can easily find different kind of resources and organizing in to our video.  </p> 
		<p>The most challenging part of the project for me is the video making; I am the person who takes the responsibility to make the whole video, at the beginning, I don’t even know how the video is made form, and I am confusing with so many things such as, cutting the video into different part, how to connecting the films we shot or how to add the background music. </p> 
		<p>I think we did take a systematic approach, first of all, we choosing a topic for our film and then we designing the acting part. Secondly, we are searching the commercial that could possibly cause the shopping addiction, and then, we start to choose a place to film our video and find different people to interview with. At last, I collected all the material in my laptop and use an app called iMovie to make our video. </p> 
		<p>I think researching on the news and articles are the most beneficial for our video because it gives us the real world information about our topic, and we collect that information in our narration. The narration in our video is one of important parts is our video, and I did research to design the narration. Narration could directly explain the issue to the audience, so I look up the news and some articles that are related to the shopping addition. Alex is the one who narrating the film, because of the research he could clearly explained what is shopping addiction, the reason why people addicted to it and couple solutions to solve the problem in his narration. </p> 
		<p> I think the least beneficial research resources are the movies about to shopping addiction. In order to have a better acting about the shopping addiction, I watched different type of movies, but those movies are all concentrated on main character’s funny life stories instead of focusing on the real issue.</p> 
		<p>The interaction of my group is helping us to completing this project efficiently because everyone is assisting each other to complete other team member’s work. For example, when I need a background music to add into the video other team member will provides me different pieces of music that is could fit our topic; and I will help other team member to film, I was a cameraman when they acting in the meridian mall. Simba is the one who take responsibility in the interviewing part, his job is to interview people who might have shopping addiction, actually we help him to interview people who around us.  </p> 
		<p>First of all working in this group I felt I learned a lot, and I realized the teamwork is very important, instead of each member doing their own work, working together makes the process more enjoyable and more efficiently. We only use a week to complete the whole project.    </p> 
		<p>We did not have too much time to work on our project together because everyone in the group has different schedule so having a good plan is important. I think the plan we had is helpful. During the week, we had several times meeting and we will give each member different tasks to complete until next meeting. Using my tasks as an example, in the first meeting I had been told to figure out which app that can help us to make the video and how to use it. In the seconded meeting I was decided to find some resources about the topic. During the weekend, we all met together and went to the mall to film. </p>
		<p>If we had more time to do the project, I think we will put more acting into our video. We had lack of time to film, so that we did not acting too much. Unlike those movies form Internet, acting of ourselves can directly point to the issue and provides a clear view to our audiences.</p>
		<p>The part of interviewing different students is the most effective aspect of our video. We put the interview part in the beginning of our video because when audiences are watching the video they can ask themselves the same question that appears in the video to help them understand what the issues is. And the interview could also be a content of our video because the questions in the interview are basically what the video is about. </p>
		<p>I was trying to recall the documentary that we watched during the class, I found out that in beginning of that documentary introduced couple issues that people are not have well understanding right now, such as, why those skull have holes and how is there is god exist in the world who teach them the knowledge that help them cure the illness. So I decide to use the same design to make our video. </p>
