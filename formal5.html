			<p>Will supply chain keep developing in the future? “Without a doubt, logistics and SCM will continue to grow in importance as companies continue to pursue outsourcing, expand their international operations, and do business in a global economic environment. Whatever the field is called that manages product flows, which at the moment is SCM, the trend is set. Here are the major challenges likely to confront SCM in the near future.”(Ballou, Ronald H, 2007) In the future, the supply will not stabilized in traditional process, it will developing into a high levels of information sharing, effective business processes and high-performing value systems that the world a sustainable competitive advantage. Due to the increasing of global competitions, supply can has transforming a new level called value chain, which is a core force of establishing sustainable competitive advantages for the future companies. </p>
			<p>College required students at least take one writing course because almost all the field of study need writing skills. Writing courses are help student to practice the ability of organizing their thought and writing down in the right from so that the readers could understand their idea. “Writing permits asynchronous communication. Because it does not base the act of communication upon presence, it does not require the person communicating to be in either the same place or the same time as the person receiving the communication. The one communicating information places it in a form that permits someone else to receive it later. Writing, printing, cinema, and video are all forms of asynchronous communication.” (George, 2008) In the other word, writing helps people to have logic and other forms of complex thought. This also happening in the field of supply chain management, employees often devote up to three hours each day to express their thoughts in writing. They are spending most of their times on writing emails, memos, report or other documents. Thus, to gain a great writing skill in the college is necessary.  </p>
			<p>Supply chain management is one of majors in the business college, so that the college provides business core courses, which is including math, accounting, computing, economics and statistics. Each of them will lead students to understand business and learn new skills that they will need in their future. For example, learning math can make student become sensitive to numbers; learning accounting can training student to keeping accounts. More importantly, the statistics course (STT 315) is a significant course for the SCM major student because this is a first course in probability and statistic primarily for business majors. Statistic course contains data analysis, probability models, random variables, confidence intervals, and test of hypotheses with business applications. These applications are often used in the field of supply chain management. After you finished all the basic subjects, you are already in a right form to learn the major core courses.  </p>
			<p>In order to have a great performance in the field of Supply Chain Management, have a great experience in the college is also important because college is a place where can gives students’ professional skills, training their abilities, creating their network circle. </p>
			<p>Students will have to take four core SCM courses in the college, and they are Procurement and Supply Chain Management, Manufacturing Planning and Control, Logistics and Transportation Management and Supply Chain Application and policy. SCM major student will usually start with Procurement and Supply Chain Management. (SCM371) C. Prahinski who is an instructor for the Supply Chain Management courses in Michigan State University said that SCM 371 is the starting point of the Supply Chain, which is about purchase. In this course, you will learn the process of Purchasing, procurement cycle, and relationships with suppliers.</p>
