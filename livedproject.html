                <h1>Changing major by technology</h1>
                <p>     Are you willing to spend more money and time on going out to buy things you need in the chilly weather or just lie by a warm fire and download a shopping app on your smartphone? Items that you bought will directly come to you and the only thing you need to do is a few finger swipes on your phones. This technology also gave me the inspiration for changing my major from media to supply chain management, even though I was still struggling in a week before I came to America for my first year of college. However, look at the big picture, supply chain has never been more vital since the smartphone shopping apps become popular. </p>
                <p>     I woke up the morning of a special day, Chinese Valentine’s Day, and I felt tired and nervous. My poor nerves had been on edge for a couple days; of course, it has nothing to do with a girl friend, because I hadn’t get one yet, but it was all about changing my major before I went to College. I picked media major when I was applied to college, however I felt media was not my cup of tea, so why did I pick a major I did not like?  The reason might sound funny, I actually did not pick my major; my father did. My father is a stereotypical Chinese parent who planned everything for their kids; he was managed my whole life including what kinds hobbies I had growing up and what kind of job I would to get in my future. I thought to myself, this is not the way I am going to live my life. So I want to change my father’s mind and change my major from media to supply chain management.</p>
                <p>     Before meeting my father, I stood in the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror. I felt like I am a thirty-year-old man with a bird’s nest built on the top of my head. Although I am looking tired but my brain has already began to think about the best way to persuade my father to allow me change my major. I washed up quickly and went to the dining table and ate the breakfast with my mother. The breakfast was really tasty which relaxed me a little bit. </p>
                <p>     During breakfast, I felt anxious because my father was sitting in front of me and I hadn’t found any better reasons to persuade him, which cause me distress. Until we all finished the meal, I still did not say anything about my change in major.</p>
                <p>    “Mengzhen, have you bought all the stuff that you want to bring with you to your college?” My mother asked me after the breakfast.</p>
                <p>     “Not yet, but I will do it later.” I said.</p>
                <p>     “You better do it today, otherwise you might be running out of time!” She seemed a trifle anxious. </p>
                <p>      “What? Why?” I asked.</p>
                <p>     “Because you are going to college four days later!” </p>
                <p>      I was frozen for a second and looked up the calendar in my cell phone right a way. “Oh shoot! The summer was so fun that I forgot the time.” I complained and wished my mother could give me an extra day. </p>
                <p>      My mother was staring at me and saying nothing.</p>
                <p>      “Alright, I will be prepared as soon as possible!” I compromised.</p>
                <p>       I spend a morning to packed up my clothes and I quickly wrote down a list of items that I need. After the lunch, I started my purchasing at the biggest shopping mall in the downtown of the city. Nevertheless, there always have many things in our lives go by contraries. I was shocked when I stepped into the shopping mall because the mall is like have a huge concert that contains thousands people. People lined up in front of every boutique and most of them are couples. Looked at such unusual phenomenon and I started to wondering why. </p>
                <p>      Remember which special day I woke up in this morning? It is Chinese Valentine’s Day! I realized by looking are the advertisements in some stores. Obviously, I guess everyone knows what will happen next. Unfortunately, I spend a whole afternoon waiting in lines and ends up with a pair of socks!</p>
                <p>      At 7 clocks at night, I was sitting in the Starbucks to have a rest. My mind was blink because I could not think a way that can help me to finish the task that my mother gives to me. Like everyone always do in a WI-IF covered coffee shop, I start to play my smart phone and surfing online; and I did know that all the problems that I have will be soon solved by my smart phone. I remember I was playing a game called “clash of clan”, which is a free game app that always has ads pop out. Those ads usually annoyed me, but this time was different, there is an ads called “T-mall” that catches my eyes; which is a smart phone shopping apps.</p>
                <p>      I quickly downloaded it from the apps store, and when I opened the T-mall shopping apps the first thing I saw was a coupon for a type of shampoo. After a few seconds of loading, a search bar popped out and then I typed in “hair dryer” into the search bar and clicked the search button. All kinds of different hair driers showed up on my cell phone screen, and one thing that surprised me is that they all cheaper than those items in the normal market. You can also look at the good and negative comments for the item. I chose one of my favorites and put them into the shopping cart. After few minutes, all the items were on my list are founded and I put those into the cart. I spent another minute to input my address and credit number and placed the orders. Is this really happening? After I placed the order, I started wonder to myself. Why did I not find this out earlier today？</p>
                <p>      After looking at more and more shopping apps, I found out that the function of the shopping apps is far more powerful than I initially imagine. This shopping apps not only have a convenient process for buying, but also have a function called “scan it” which helps consumers to compare the goods in one store with those online, this ultimately helps because consumers could find the best deal in order to save the most money. It can also share the items that I bought with my friend. </p>
                <p>      After the Online shopping experience in a real shopping mall, I decide to go home because I got tried just hanging out at the store. On my way home, I started to think about the other serious problem that I did not solve yet, which was how to persuade my father to change my major.</p>
                <p>     First of all, the major that I would like to choose is supply chain management，because I think almost everything in our life is related to this major. Supply chain management is a tool that connecting the world together by transporting all kinds of goods floating around the world. In the other words, supply chain management integrate topics is from manufacturing, purchasing and transportation. For example, pancake, wheat bread or coffee all those stuff you eat in this morning need to went through the supply chain and come to your house from the world. If there anything needs to assemble and move to one place to the other, it requires supply chain. And it is about everything. Since the world has been globalized, Supply chain has never been such vital.</p>
                <p>     So how I do I persuade my father to allow me to change my major to the SCM? I look at my cell phone and I suddenly feel it dawned one me. The shopping apps! The smartphone shopping apps is becoming more and more popular because this is so convenience that people only need a few fingertips and the item they bought will come directly to you. Yet it is also need to powerful supply chain to support the apps because consumers also expect the item delivery as fast as possible. So once the apps are getting global and popular, a good supply chain management is necessary. Now, I am convinced that SCM is the major I want to learn and this will be the best reason to help persuade my father! Just two later, when all the items are delivered, I showed my father how convenient that the shopping apps was and I also show him that SCM is a major that with a bright future. Since my father was also believed that my suggestion was right, he finally gives me an allowing nod. </p>
