			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>The video used three aspects to explain why people in the U.S. are over-consuming; and why shopping became a big part of culture in the U.S.; and these three aspects are the advices from policy makers, tricks of business runners and the impact of advertisements. </p>
			<p>The government is a department which doing everything for their people, but sometimes they also make mistakes. In the video, Annie Leonard mentioned that after the 911, the U.S. governors did not suggest people to pray or to hope but to shop. After that, the identity of people in the U.S. has changed, which is not mothers, doctor, teachers or farmer but consumers. Everyone in this nation is contributing to flow the material around the country, and cause a huge of wastes. Annie Leonard also gives a number that surprise me, she said that 99% of items that we bought and store in our house will become trash in six mouth. Although the government is trying to rebuild the economy, but their advices is making things worse. For example, the suggestion of shop is like a cosmetic surgery that fixes the problem on the surface but it will bring the worse problem eventually. I am not saying that people in the U.S. should not listen to the government but everyone could try to be more rationally. </p>
			<p>The government’ advices is not only reason that drive people crazy in shopping; those business runner and economist are also have the responsibility for this. The economist Victor Lebow said that “ Our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction, our ego satisfaction, in consumption…we need things consumed, burned up, replaced and discarded at an ever-accelerating rate.” Which is means that the businessmen are trying to encourage people to consume without considering any results. The phrase “Planned obsolescence” is the name of the trick that those businessman use to push people to keep consuming. Annie Leonard gave us a funny definition of these two words, which is “to designed for the dump.” Those businessmen are actually made item to become useless as quick as possible, so people can quickly buy a new one. Those technology products are also update fast, things like cell phone or computers. Sometimes the only change that those companies made is the design of their product. However, how those companies make people such enthusiastic to buy their product? </p>
			<p>“Perceived Obsolescence” is the other words that describe how those companies in the U.S. attract their consumers to shop. Advertisement is paly the big role in this trick. According the dictionary, the definition of the Advertisement is a form of communication for marketing and used to encourage or persuade an audience (viewers, readers or listeners; sometimes a specific group) to continue or take some new action. In the other word, the ultimate purpose of the advertisement is to encourage people to buy more. Today, there is more than three thousand advertisement that keep rolling on the TV each day. For example, you holding an Iphone4 in the Iphone5 year, it may seem like you not as valuable as people around you who are hold holding an Iphone5. It is not because the Iphone5 have much more powerful function than anything else, it is because people watch the ads on the television and become so enthusiastic to buy their product. Since people are switching the stuff to the brand new very quickly, it cause lots of things had been throw way when they still can perfectly functioning. Advertisement could be a guide that helps you to find things that you need, but always follow the advertisement to consume is not acceptable.</p>
