			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>The environment around us already contains so much pollution that many species have disappeared, and resources that the earth provides are more and more scarcer. The reason why this is happening is because we are wasting natural resources on products are essentially useless. Shopping has already become the common entertainment that everyone will do during his or her free time; and the over-consuming is still a serious social issue in our society. However, as long as people start to notice the problem and try to be rational consumers, these problems can be solved. At last, look at your room again, how many things that you bought have already become useless?  </p>
